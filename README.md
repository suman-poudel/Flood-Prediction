# Flood-Prediction

This repository contains comparasion of three models, Random Forest Regressor, Artificial Neural Network for regression, and LSTM, that helps to predict the probability of flood. RF and ANN succesfully predicted the model however LSTM failed to learn from the model due to vanishing gradient problem. The dataset was downloaded in zip format from website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naiyakhalid/flood-prediction-dataset
