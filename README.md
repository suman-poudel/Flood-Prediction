# Flood Prediction using RF, ANN and LSTM

This repository contains a comparison of three models: Random Forest Regressor, Artificial Neural Network for regression/classification, and LSTM, that help predict the probability of flood. ANN performed best, and LSTM performed the worst in both the classification and regression tasks. 
The dataset for regression was downloaded in zip format from the website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naiyakhalid/flood-prediction-dataset 
The dataset for classification was downloaded in zip format from the website: https://github.com/n-gauhar/Flood-prediction
